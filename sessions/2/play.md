a heroic browser, a thoughtful server, and the friends who help them talk to each other
=======================================================================================

A dramatization of what happens when you type "http://chadoh.com/cset160" into your browser. How does your browser communicate with some server across the internet? What are all the pieces in between?


The Cast (in order of appearance)
---------------------------------

* **Browser**: our hero; a talented artist who needs good instructions
* Browser's **friend**: has good ideas for Browser
* **Computer** Browser's landlord
* **Router** A lazy grouch! Computer's secretary
* **Name Server 1**: claims to know some things
* **Name Server 2**: knows Server's digits
* **Server**: has art instructions for Browser


Without Further Ado: The Script!
--------------------------------

**FRIEND**: Browser! I have a project for you! You can get it from
chadoh.com, and the instructions are called “/cset160”.

**BROWSER**: Thank you kindly, Friend! Let me look that up. Let’s see... I
will need the number for chadoh.com. [_pause_] Hey, Computer! Do
you know the number for “chadoh.com”?

**COMPUTER**: I have, like, almost no one in my address book. Hang on,
Router usually knows these things. [_pause_] Router? Have you been
listening?

**ROUTER**: [_waking up, disgruntled_] Huh? What? What do you want?

**COMPUTER**: Do you know the number for chadoh.com? Browser would
like a document called “/cset160” from her.

**ROUTER**: [_lying_] Yeeaaaahh, hang on a second, let me look it up...
[_whispering to DNS SERVER 1_] Pssst. Yo. You know the number for
chadoh.com?

**DNS SERVER 1**: [_quickly_] Hang on. I don’t know about .com stuff, myself.
[_ROUTER promptly falls asleep_] [_to DNS SERVER 2_] Sir? chadoh.com, please.

**DNS SERVER 2**: [_very quickly_] 75.101.145.87

**DNS SERVER 1**: [_to Router_] Router, wake up! That number you wanted.
75.101.145.87. For chadoh.com

**ROUTER**: [_waking up_] Oh, oh, oh, right, [_to computer_] hey computer, the
number you wanted is 75.101.145.87

**COMPUTER**: Thanks. Can you ask the server at that number for the document
“/cset160”, please? [_ROUTER sighs, picks up a phone, calls SERVER_]

**SERVER**: [_into phone_] Hello?

**ROUTER**: Hey. Could you please send me “/cset160”.

**SERVER**: [_with great fanfare_] Whhyyyy, ceeertainly. [_looks through a
file, pulls out a document, makes a copy of it, puts copy in an envelope_]
It’s on it’s way! [_throws the envelope to router_] Have a lovely day!
[_hangs up_]

**ROUTER**: Hm. You too. [_yawns_] Computer, here go. [_hands envelope to
Computer_]

**COMPUTER**: [_to Browser_] Here you go, browser!
