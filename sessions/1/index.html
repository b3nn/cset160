What are web languages?

How does the client-side vs server-side idea play into the notion of web languages?

David Heinemeier Hansson (dhh) created Ruby on Rails in 2004. Like many others who were attracted to Ruby in the early and mid '00s, dhh was a Java refugee.

* Rails helped popularize Ruby in US
* Rails inspired many other web frameworks
* Rails is still a popular choice for building websites

# an *excerpt*

???

&gt; My conscience wonâ€™t let me call Ruby a computer language. That would imply that the language works primarily on the computerâ€™s terms. That the language is designed to accommodate the computer, first and foremost. That therefore, we, the coders, are foreigners, seeking citizenship in the computerâ€™s locale. Itâ€™s the computerâ€™s language and we are translators for the world.
&gt;
&gt; But what do you call the language when your brain begins to think in that language? When you start to use the languageâ€™s own words and colloquialisms to express yourself. Say, the computer canâ€™t do that. How can it be the computerâ€™s language? It is ours, we speak it natively!
